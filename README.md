# RGBMatrix
A Python implementation for processing images in RGB color mode. Only numpy and imageio are used as external code

## Rules
Images are read in e.g. as JPG, PSD, PNG or TIFF. If these are not yet available in 16bit, they are scaled to 16bit (all internal adjustments are made in uint16).

## Libraries
### numpy
Version: 1.26
### imageio
Version: 2.33
